Big Features to Add:

- Also add some way of cliff climbing
	- either with new nodes
	- or with some special animation

- Ladders
	- can be built on the side of a node when there is an adjacent node higher up in that directions

- Implement MovingEntity ClimbingSkill attribute
	=> None: Fences, ladders and cliffs always block
	=> Basic: Ladders and easy fences
	=> Advanced: Cliffs and advanced fences too

- Implement animation system for climbing fences
- walls should not generally block movement, but based on entity climbing skill

- add generators
	=> flat empty grass
	=> current perlin with some trees and cliffs
	=> add dropdown for different generators

- check why it takes so long to generate big (16*32) worlds

- make a dropdown for load world

- make detailed example map

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor

- interface IWorld for world with documentation

- Static entities with weird shapes
	=> adjust collider generation accordingly
	=> occupiednodes turns into footprint
	=> shape is a dictionary<vector2int, list<bool>> whereas the key is the position in the footprint and the value list represents which nodes are blocked based on height
	=> keep dimensions as a general entity attribute, add shape to static entity

- fix entity moving backwards when giving new GoTo command while moving already

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Add door WallType (Passable, but not seethrough)

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1

- improve water shader

- dont allow suface nodes with walls in water
	- affect canplacewater
	- affect canbuildwall

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Make editor script for static entity that allows defining shape and previewing box colliders

- Add different air path types
	> each has their own mesh generator
	> each has their own attribute how many tiles they block above and below

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

- Make profiler performance tests with high speed, high vision entities in editor

- Improve Camera:
	> Shift to increase speed
	> Faster zoom (alt to decrease zoom speed)
	> Fix zoom speed on low fps

- Fix rare bug of air node not being selected exactly on edge

- fix: water fill algorithm should stop after a while (like 1000 tiles?)

- In terrain blend transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots

- Procedural Static Entities

- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)

- decouple entity vision from node vision
	=> mainly so newly placed entities outside of a players vision are not automatically rendered

- add system to draw entities on last seen position from that players perspective

- add new item framework
	- items behave like static entities on map, but way more limited
	- only one 1 tile, no vision, movement etc.

- add inventory system
	- entities can pick up and carry items
	- add carry capacity attribute to entities

- START CTF

(- decouple entity visibility from node visiblity)

(- impelemnt SurfaceAirNodes:	
	> Rendered like surface nodes (1x1x1 in size)
	> BaseHeight = x and Height = {x+1,x+1,x+1,x+1})

(- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node)
