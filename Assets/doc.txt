------------------------- CTF v0.0.7 -------------------------

add float menu as base ui element (maybe take from keep wandering)

context menu shouldnt go off screen
context menu should disappear when clicking somewhere

add item actions
	drop always available (except when on other item)
	swap item available when on other item
	item-specific actions (i.e. "consume")

hovering item shows more info

show item actions on float menu when clicking item

Add Items to CTF:
	new Comp_CtfItem & CompProperties_CtfItem
	Active or Passive
	Characters can hold 1 item at a time
	Item is shown in CharacterInfo next to bars in a little square
	new action: use item
	new action: drop item
	new actions are added to special actions
	new actions can also be done by clicking on item in character info

Walking on an item adds it to the characters inventory if they don't hold another item yet

REQUIRES HEDIFF SYSTEM that some items can give
	Hediff: "Motivated"
	Hediff: "Visible"

>>> List of items <<<
	Active: Items that can be activated any time
		Consumables: Foods/Drinks for instant stamina & AP regeneration, maybe other lasting effect, free to use

			> Tag-Gun: Tag any opponent in your territory with direct line of sight
			> Camouflage cloak: Get "Invisible" for 2 turns
	Passive:
		Equipment: Items that are worn by the character and visible.
			> Spyglass: Vision +5
			> Running shoes: Running +5
			> Water helmet: Regeneration +5
	Placeable: Items that are placaeble in the world

	Companion: Neutral characters that can be activated to become part of your Temperature
		Robots: Characters with battery life (BL) instead of stamina, depletes (-5) instead of regenerates each turn. Disappear when battery is empty
			> Little Robot: Low stat character with 100 BL

Alberto should be able to climb cliffs and more walls

"Scenting" Skill to detect things and flag outside of vision range:
	0 for humans, high for dogs
	Scented things get drawn as kind of a blob near the item (not revealing where and what EXACTLY it is)

Notifications:
	Rimworld like messages that appear for a player on certain triggers
	Messages can have related entities, that the camera jumps to when clicked on (cycles through them with each click)
	also shows arrows towards related entities when hovering over it
	Examples for notifications
		enemy gets visible
		character has been tagged (with reason)
		enemy stood on your trap
		you stood on enemy trap

------------------------- END CTF v0.0.7 -------------------------

------------------------- CTF v0.0.8 -------------------------

try hosting a dedicated server that handles connections

if that works, create lobby browser

if that works, try hosting the game on a website

------------------------- END CTF v0.0.8 -------------------------



Framework Updates:

Bug: Doors are still bugged, vision colliders are at wrong rotations
Bug: Seeing an airnode from below should only mark it as explored, not visible
Bug: Should not  be able to see/explore entities that are on top of air nodes that you are below (else you see stuff a floor higher than you)
Bug: In RoomPerspective cutoff mode, sometimes the edge of walls that should be invisible because of perspective still get rendered because adjacent wall does too (fog of war overlap)


Entity Pivot:
entities have an additional PivotDirection (SW, SE, NW, NE). Default is SW
	it defines what corner of the entity OriginNode represents
	adapt GetOccupiednodes and GetWorldPosition to support this new system
	when implemented, remove/make optional requirement that footprint needs to be fully connected. If it's not, then these just don't get added to occupied nodes
		i need this i.e. so that rocks can clip into cliffs
		THEN ALSO CHECK in blockmapnode.isImpassable if another nearby entity blocks this node according to its pivot, size and shape

Increase performance of detecting climb transitions on empty perlin map
maybe also other steps
Goal: 512 x 512 map (32 chunks) in 10 seconds preferred, 20 max. Now it takes like 50

fix arc for hop transitions - arc always has a height of 1 and going further down/up is just straight

Walls and Fences should be entities - climbability should be an inherent part of entities

45Â° angles for walls and surfaces, would be make round shapes and corners way nicer



--- Entity Nodes

make it possible to define invisible EntityNodes per entity
	> List<EntityNodeData>, where key is the local cell and value is the node altitudes
	> Can be defined up to 1 higher than entity height (like a crate has height 2, but a node could be defined at (0/2/0) with altitude (0,0,0,0) to make it walkable on top)
	> if it is forbid placing airnodes there
	> maybe an easy option to just add entity nodes everywhere at the top of the entity

EntityNodeData:
	Vector3Int pos, Dictionary<Direction, int> altitude, SurfaceDef surface

vision of entity node is based on entity
add HoveredEntityNode to world
	> make it possible to add fences/other entites on EntityNodes 

same with invisible EntityWalls for climbability
	> List<EntityWallData>
	> EntityWallData = Vector2Int + Direction + WallMaterialDef

---

give everyone names
turn counter and display

mapgen forest: don't replace concrete with dirt path
mapgen forest: wide road with cars
mapgen forest: river
mapgen forest: hedges should be straighter

--- Entity Update

- Allow static entities to be able to allow having moving entities on them
	> requires jumping update
	> add container

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor
	> same way as moving entities
	> IsPassable, BlocksVision, Dimensions, RequiresFlatTerrain

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

---

--- New cover layer for Nodes (for EcosystemSimulation)

New CoverLayerDef
nodes can have different layers stacked on top of each other
examples are AutumnLeaves, Snow, Moss

---

Framework: Make vision system optional
	i.e. Ecosystem sim won't need it / can't afford its performance cost


- Add MaxSteepness movement attribute and disallow walking on very steep nodes

- Expand entity shapes
	> Rework dimensions attribute of entities
	> Add new EntityShape class/struct
	> Each node within dimensions has a defined vision hitbox that can be [Full/None/Wall_N/E/S/W]
	> make it possible that entities can block a combination of full nodes, sides and corners
	> Impact vision
	> Impact navmesh

- Allow entites to have their own nodes
---

- Editor-Bug: Decreasing tool size in ground sculpting doesn't remove overlay over previous chunks
- Editor-Feature: World Generation Tool: Expand by x chunks in direction

- Editor improvements:
	> pipette: press a button when hovering a wall/air node/fence etc. to instantly switch selection to that type
	> wall height
	> wall tool: click on existing wall to change shape/material (as long as side is valid for selected shape)
	> air node drag
	> proc entity drag
	> fence drag (same side along direction, i.e. if placed east you can drag along x axis and always place east)
	> tunnel (convert ground node with all walls, entites etc to air node and create new grass ground node 1 below)


Rework shader for entities
 - Allow option to use uv space instead of world space
	> Apply this to doors

Make a list of material indexes colorable in editor
 - Save color in new attribute Color in entity and EntityData
 - all materials with an index present in the list will be given that color
 - Use for cars

 Water improvements
- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)
- Water flowing in one direction
- Waterfall
- water tool rework:
	> make max depth a const 3
	> make shoreheight based on mouse pointer y coordinate

Animation system for walking / climbing entities
	> silly with just hopping from one side to the other with slight rotation

Sounds

Add "DrawSlopeAsStairs" to SurfaceDef.Renderproperties
	If true, all slopes (IsSlope = true) are drawn as stairs in DrawNodeSurface()

- strength & destroy
	> movingentities get a new strength attribute
	> staticentities get a new durability attribute
	> walls get it too
	> entities can destroy for big stamina cost

CTF: Minimap
	> shows tiles
	> shows current camera position
	> shows character positions
	> interactable to move camera

CTF: Make flags carriable
	> make a framework for carryable entties/items
	> certain characters can carry it
	> impassable zones moves with carried flag
	> if character holding flag gets tagged = game over, no matter where
	> win game when flag is back home

CTF: Dogs need a nearby master to work

CTF: Jumping ability
	> to hop over fences
	> to hop over gaps
	> jumping ability 1 = hop over 1 tile gap, hop over 1 tile fence

CTF: Horses
	- Rideable by humans
	
CTF: Flying
	- Hawk
	- Can't tag or be tagged, fly at fixed height
	- Only give vision

Framework: fix: water fill algorithm should stop after a while (like 1000 tiles?)

- add new item framework
	- items behave like static entities on map, but way more limited
	- only one 1 tile, no vision, movement etc.

- add inventory system
	- entities can pick up and carry items
	- add carry capacity attribute to entities

- sound & smell
	hearing & smelling

CTF: "Scenting" Skill to detect things and flag outside of vision range:
	0 for humans, high for dogs
	Scented things get drawn as kind of a blob near the item (not revealing where and what EXACTLY it is)

- dig/tunnel?

- Add additional movement methods (jump/fly)
- Stealth/Invisibility
- Teleportation

- Weather / Temperature (Snow/Mud)

More static entities (see following for inspiration):
	> project zomboid streams
	> fallout tactics streams


CTF: Add (last seen x turns ago) to entities not visible but explored
CTF: Rest ability (costs 10 AP, restores 10 stamina)

CTF: Neutral items that refresh stamina or give modifiers
CTF: Neutral items that can be picked up (requires inventory system)

CTF: Lobby: Back to Menu Button
	with proper server stop as host
	and server disconnect as client
	send message to others in lobby that player left



CTF: Pick up Flag (requires inventory system)
	> characters can now enter flag zone
	> characters in flag zone are "disabled" for the whole turn they were in
	> "disabled characters" cannot tag enemies
	> flag can be picked up when moving on that node for a cost
	> character can move with impairment with flag
	> flag zone moves with character holding flag
	> character holding flag can be tagged by enemy to win the game
	> flag can be dropped whenever by character for a cost

CTF Forest Generator:
	- elevated path towards building door (with stairs if necessary)
	- bridges when paths go over water


CTF: Neutral moving entities
 - Wolves
 - 1 sneaky wolf

CTF: more logic for dogs
  - dogs have a chance to not listen to commands and something else instead (random needs to be applied before sending to server so its synced)
  - can get distracted

CTF: Improve performance for far away pathfinding or disable, just find a solution for the lag spikes

CTF: more general modifier system
	> modifiers have a duration and effect, name, description, icon
	> move jail time to modifier
	> add ui for modifiers

CTF: Rework hover pathfinding
	> Hover on unreachable node = no path preview
	> Hover on node with !canStandOn = red path preview
	> Hover on node within possible moves = green path preview
	> Hover on reachable node outside possible moves = yellow path preview
	> Cache paths (forever since they can never change atm)
	> Path preview max distance: If distance is bigger take node in that direction that is at max distance and show path to there
	> Clicking on yellow path moves as far as possible

CTF Map Ideas:
		
	- Caste ruins:
		- inspired by ruine farnsburg
		- Mix of inside and outside areas

	- Brutalist structure:
		- non-realistic concrete structures
		- hard edges
		- stairs
		- many layers
		- inspired by old video games

	- Valley:
		- High elevation on both sides where players start
		- River in the low valley in the middle neutral area
		- Some bridge crossings over the river
		- Some cliffs in the elevation

	- Farm:
		- Many crop fields with paths and/or tree lines between them
		- Crops that can be moved through but reduce vision (i.e. corn)
		- Big farm building somewhere in neutral area

	- Dungeon:
		- inspired by fallout tactics, binding of isaac
		- just random rooms stitched together

	- MegaRandom:
		- just repeats different world modifiers from other generators
		- some restrctions (i.e. in first step just terrain modifiers, then entity modifiers, then buildings, etc.)

-------- POSSIBLE PROJECT IDEAS WITH FRAMEWORK --------

- EcosystemSimulation3D
- Solo/Squad RPG (like CDDA)
- Ironmon-like roguelike


-------- KNOWN ISSES --------

Camera MSAA Anti-Aliasing is causing black pixel artifacts on air node mesh seams that use the surface shader
	> so MSAA is turned off for now

Surface blending in SurfaceShader isn't perfect (but good enough so it's usually not noticable)

-------- RETIRED IDEAS ------------

- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1

Add a dissolve cutout feature to NodeMaterialShader that can dissolve an area around a specific screen space coordinate:
