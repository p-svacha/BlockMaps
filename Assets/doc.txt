Big Features to Add:

- move "surface" attribute to surface node
	- remove water surface
	- remove isPaintable attribute from surface

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots
	> make a release

- cache paths in one "MoveCharacterTool" session

-------- BUILDING UPDATE ------------

- wall preview with height
- make height adjustable with (ctrl+scrollwheel)
- show wall type attributes in editor (climbability)

- make a ladderpreview
- make switchable to which higher node the ladder should go (with ctrl+scrollwheel)

- Add door WallType (Passable, but not seethrough)
- add window (impassable, see-through)

- Add some kind of roof system
	- maybe just allow changing height on normal air nodes (like on surface)
	- allow path mesh generation for all shapes
	- and then add a second air node type: roof


-------- WORLD GEN UPDATE ------------

- add generators
	=> flat empty grass
	=> current perlin with some trees and cliffs
	=> add dropdown for different generators

- check why it takes so long to generate big (16*32) worlds

- make a dropdown for load world
- make message "are you sure" when overwriting

- make detailed example map


-------- UNSORTED ------------

- vision on moving entities
	> decouple entity vision from node vision
	> add 2nd player in editor
	> add ui for all display options (inlcuding vision player)
	> impelement lastseenposition per player and render there
	> add system to draw entities on last seen position from that players perspective

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor
	> same way as moving entities

- bug: sometimes cliffs still get drawn when changin heights on big area

- interface IWorld for world with documentation
- also IEntity and IBlockmapNode

- Static entities with weird shapes
	> adjust collider generation accordingly
	> occupiednodes turns into footprint
	> shape is a dictionary<vector2int, list<bool>> whereas the key is the position in the footprint and the value list represents which nodes are blocked based on height
	> keep dimensions as a general entity attribute, add shape to static entity
	> Make editor script for static entity that allows defining shape and previewing box colliders

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)

- turn-based movement
	> entites have Action Points
	> entities have Stamina
	> Action Point get set and depleted within 1 turn
	> Stamina is longer term and gets regenrated only a bit per turn

- strength & destroy
	> movingentities get a new strength attribute
	> staticentities get a new durability attribute
	> walls get it too
	> entities can destroy for big stamina cost


- dont allow suface nodes with walls in water
	- affect canplacewater
	- affect canbuildwall

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Add different air path types
	> each has their own mesh generator
	> each has their own attribute how many tiles they block above and below

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

- Make profiler performance tests with high speed, high vision entities in editor

- Improve Camera:
	> Shift to increase speed
	> Faster zoom (alt to decrease zoom speed)
	> Fix zoom speed on low fps

- fix: water fill algorithm should stop after a while (like 1000 tiles?)

- In terrain blend transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- Procedural Static Entities

- add new item framework
	- items behave like static entities on map, but way more limited
	- only one 1 tile, no vision, movement etc.

- add inventory system
	- entities can pick up and carry items
	- add carry capacity attribute to entities

- add some new static entities
	> for new static entity ideas watch project zomboid streams

- Add additional movement methods (jump/fly)
- Add strength attribute with that you can destroy walls, entities
- Stealth/Invisibility
- Teleportation
- Terrain affinity

- Weather / Temperature (Snow/Mud)

- START CTF



-------- RETIRED IDEAS ------------

- decouple entity visibility from node visiblity

- impelemnt SurfaceAirNodes:	
	> Rendered like surface nodes (1x1x1 in size)
	> BaseHeight = x and Height = {x+1,x+1,x+1,x+1}

- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1
