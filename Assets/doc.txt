Big Features to Add:

- Fix navmesh around diagonal shores
- Fix placing big entities around water canplace check
- FIX MOVING through water
- fix selection indicator in water
- fix hovered node water

- Encode editorentity data in typeid (vision, movement, height, swim)

- Make air nodes removable

- Fences/Walls
	=> placed in one direction on one node
	=> take hovermode like when changing height
	=> drawn as one mesh
	=> visible depending on node they stand on
	=> have height
	=> might block vision
	=> might make node impassable in direction they are placed
	=> might be climbable
	=> different types (fence and wall to start)

- Render walls on map edge
	=> from node height
	=> or water height on water bodies

- rework invisible tile drawing
	=> redraw mesh when visiblity changes
	=> always generate full mesh for collider
	=> revert shader visibility discard
	=> should fix shadow-bug
OR
- add custom shadowcaster that ignored discarded pixels

- add generators
	=> flat empty grass
	=> current perlin with some trees and cliffs
	=> add dropdown for different generators

- removable air nodes

- Ladders

- make a dropdown for load world

- make detailed example map

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor

- combine airpathsloe and airpath into 1 type

- Static entities with weird shapes
	=> adjust collider generation accordingly
	=> occupiednodes turns into footprint
	=> shape is a dictionary<vector2int, list<bool>> whereas the key is the position in the footprint and the value list represents which nodes are blocked based on height
	=> keep dimensions as a general entity attribute, add shape to static entity

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1

- Fix shadow rendering bug with shader discard and re-enable shadows of terrain

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Make editor script for static entity that allows defining shape and previewing box colliders

- Add different air path types
	> each has their own mesh generator
	> each has their own attribute how many tiles they block above and below

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

- Make profiler performance tests with high speed, high vision entities in editor

- Improve Camera:
	> Shift to increase speed
	> Faster zoom (alt to decrease zoom speed)
	> Fix zoom speed on low fps

- Fix rare bug of air node not being selected exactly on edge

- In terrain blend transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots

- Add selection over multiple tiles (2x2, 3x3 etc.)
	> Add feature to height change, surface change and air path

- Procedural Static Entities

- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)

- START CTF

(- decouple entity visibility from node visiblity)

(- impelemnt SurfaceAirNodes:	
	> Rendered like surface nodes (1x1x1 in size)
	> BaseHeight = x and Height = {x+1,x+1,x+1,x+1})

(- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node)
