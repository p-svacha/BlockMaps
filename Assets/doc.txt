Big Features to Add:

- Fences/Walls
	=> seeing a wall but not the node center should mark the tile as explored but not visible
	=> CanPlace check with headspace
	=> See-through walls (new type: window - might be hard, but maybe possible with check on hit position in entity.Look())
	=> Passthrough-walls (new type: hedge)
	=> Climbable wall (new type: fence)
	=> Affect CanChangeHeight
	=> Affect CanPlaceEntity
	=> Affect CanBuildAirPath
	=> Affect CanBuildAirPathSlope
	=> height, height changeable
	=> Fix uv's in mesh generator

- press R to reset exploration in editor

- Render walls on map edge
	=> from node height
	=> or water height on water bodies

- Fix cliff UV's

- rework invisible tile drawing
	=> redraw mesh when visiblity changes
	=> always generate full mesh for collider
	=> revert shader visibility discard
	=> should fix shadow-bug
OR
- add custom shadowcaster that ignored discarded pixels

- Add selection over multiple tiles (2x2, 3x3 etc.)
	> Add feature to height change (only full) and surface paint

- add generators
	=> flat empty grass
	=> current perlin with some trees and cliffs
	=> add dropdown for different generators

- Ladders
	> add nonsolid laddernodes with Direction.UP and Direction.DOWN

- make a dropdown for load world

- make detailed example map

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor

- interface IWorld for world with documentation

- Static entities with weird shapes
	=> adjust collider generation accordingly
	=> occupiednodes turns into footprint
	=> shape is a dictionary<vector2int, list<bool>> whereas the key is the position in the footprint and the value list represents which nodes are blocked based on height
	=> keep dimensions as a general entity attribute, add shape to static entity

- fix entity moving backwards when giving new GoTo command while moving already

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1

- Fix shadow rendering bug with shader discard and re-enable shadows of terrain

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Make editor script for static entity that allows defining shape and previewing box colliders

- Add different air path types
	> each has their own mesh generator
	> each has their own attribute how many tiles they block above and below

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

- Make profiler performance tests with high speed, high vision entities in editor

- Improve Camera:
	> Shift to increase speed
	> Faster zoom (alt to decrease zoom speed)
	> Fix zoom speed on low fps

- Fix rare bug of air node not being selected exactly on edge

- fix: water fill algorithm should stop after a while (like 1000 tiles?)

- In terrain blend transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots

- Procedural Static Entities

- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)

- START CTF

(- decouple entity visibility from node visiblity)

(- impelemnt SurfaceAirNodes:	
	> Rendered like surface nodes (1x1x1 in size)
	> BaseHeight = x and Height = {x+1,x+1,x+1,x+1})

(- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node)
