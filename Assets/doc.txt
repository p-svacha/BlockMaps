(/)can't move on opponent character in own zone (canPerformNow = false)
(/)vision cutoff resets when arriving at destination (because character is reselected which sets it to off in deselect)
(/)nodes don't seem to get explored when moving while vision cutoff is on (test by moving character inside building with vision cutoff and look at ceiling nides)
(/)should be able to hover node through character label
(/)Game Over Screen: Set visibility to Everything
(/)ladders should work even when starting on slope

------------------------- END CTF v0.0.2 -------------------------

make CtfCharacterStatDef and CtfCharacterStat
Comp_CtfCharacter handles Dictionary<StatDef, Stat>

CtfCharactorComp defines base stats

individual attributes
humans:
Alberto (good climber)
Usain (fast, no stamina, height 4)
Eluid (good movement, extreme stamina reg)
Veronica (extremely good vision)
Katie (good swimmer, bad vision)
Adrienne  (very good with dogs)

dogs:
blotto (big, height = 2, little faster but bad stamina, better hop)
pierette (little, little slower but good stamina, better hop)

show short description of character below name in charactor info, noting biggest strength/weakness

rework how attributes are displayed in character info, so it also puts the values into perspective to how good they are relatively (bar length or stars)

------------------------- END CTF v0.0.3 -------------------------

AI: flee job
AI: enemy moves from netural into player area even though he sees player is there
AI: enemies get stuck when next node (adjacent) they want to move to is occupied
AI: Stop searching flag when it becomes explored

------------------------- END CTF v0.0.4 -------------------------

make valley map gen
	high sides with player spawns
	river in the middle
	some bridge crossings

desert map gen
	sand, cactus, mostly flat
	very few country roads through it
	wild scorpions that can put you into jail

farm map
	different crop fields with movement modifiers

------------------------- END CTF v0.0.5 -------------------------


New EditorTool: Map Modifiers
	- a function that affects the whole map
	- basically a single step of map gen process

Increase performance of detecting climb transitions on empty perlin map
maybe also other steps
Goal: 512 x 512 map (32 chunks) in 10 seconds preferred, 20 max. Now it takes like 50

fix arc for hop transitions - arc always has a height of 1 and going further down/up is just straight



--- Entity Nodes

make it possible to define invisible EntityNodes per entity
	> List<EntityNodeData>, where key is the local cell and value is the node altitudes
	> Can be defined up to 1 higher than entity height (like a crate has height 2, but a node could be defined at (0/2/0) with altitude (0,0,0,0) to make it walkable on top)
	> if it is forbid placing airnodes there
	> maybe an easy option to just add entity nodes everywhere at the top of the entity

EntityNodeData:
	Vector3Int pos, Dictionary<Direction, int> altitude, SurfaceDef surface

vision of entity node is based on entity
add HoveredEntityNode to world
	> make it possible to add fences/other entites on EntityNodes 

same with invisible EntityWalls for climbability
	> List<EntityWallData>
	> EntityWallData = Vector2Int + Direction + WallMaterialDef

---

give everyone names
turn counter and display

mapgen forest: wide road with cars
mapgen forest: river
mapgen forest: hedges should be straighter

--- Entity Update

- Allow static entities to be able to allow having moving entities on them
	> requires jumping update
	> add container

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor
	> same way as moving entities
	> IsPassable, BlocksVision, Dimensions, RequiresFlatTerrain

- Static entities with weird shapes
	> adjust collider generation accordingly
	> occupiednodes turns into footprint
	> shape is a dictionary<vector2int, list<bool>> whereas the key is the position in the footprint and the value list represents which nodes are blocked based on height
	> keep dimensions as a general entity attribute, add shape to static entity
	> Make editor script for static entity that allows defining shape and previewing box colliders

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

---

--- New cover layer for Nodes (for EcosystemSimulation)

New CoverLayerDef
nodes can have different layers stacked on top of each other
examples are AutumnLeaves, Snow, Moss

---


- Add MaxSteepness movement attribute and disallow walking on very steep nodes

- Expand entity shapes
	> Rework dimensions attribute of entities
	> Add new EntityShape class/struct
	> Each node within dimensions has a defined vision hitbox that can be [Full/None/Wall_N/E/S/W]
	> make it possible that entities can block a combination of full nodes, sides and corners
	> Impact vision
	> Impact navmesh

- Allow entites to have their own nodes
---

- Editor-Bug: Vision cutoff doesn't correctly reset when generating new map
- Editor-Bug: Decreasing tool size in ground sculpting doesn't remove overlay over previous chunks
- Editor-Feature: World Generation Tool: Expand by x chunks in direction

- Editor improvements:
	> pipette: press a button when hovering a wall/air node/fence etc. to instantly switch selection to that type
	> wall height
	> wall tool: click on existing wall to change shape/material (as long as side is valid for selected shape)
	> air node drag
	> proc entity drag
	> fence drag (same side along direction, i.e. if placed east you can drag along x axis and always place east)
	> tunnel (convert ground node with all walls, entites etc to air node and create new grass ground node 1 below)


Rework shader for entities
 - Only use transparency shader on moving objects
 - Allow option to use uv space instead of world space
	> Apply this to doors

Make a list of material indexes colorable in editor
 - Save color in new attribute Color in entity and EntityData
 - all materials with an index present in the list will be given that color
 - Use for cars

 Water improvements
- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)
- Water flowing in one direction
- Waterfall
- water tool rework:
	> make max depth a const 3
	> make shoreheight based on mouse pointer y coordinate

Animation system for walking / climbing entities
	> silly with just hopping from one side to the other with slight rotation

Sounds

Add "DrawSlopeAsStairs" to SurfaceDef.Renderproperties
	If true, all slopes (IsSlope = true) are drawn as stairs in DrawNodeSurface()

- strength & destroy
	> movingentities get a new strength attribute
	> staticentities get a new durability attribute
	> walls get it too
	> entities can destroy for big stamina cost

- Minimap
	> shows tiles
	> shows current camera position
	> shows character positions
	> interactable to move camera

- Make flags carriable
	> make a framework for carryable entties/items
	> certain characters can carry it
	> impassable zones moves with carried flag
	> if character holding flag gets tagged = game over, no matter where
	> win game when flag is back home

- Dogs need a nearby master to work

- Jumping ability
	> to hop over fences
	> to hop over gaps
	> jumping ability 1 = hop over 1 tile gap, hop over 1 tile fence

- Horses
	- Rideable by humans
	
- Flying
	- Hawk
	- Can't tag or be tagged, fly at fixed height
	- Only give vision

- fix: water fill algorithm should stop after a while (like 1000 tiles?)

- add new item framework
	- items behave like static entities on map, but way more limited
	- only one 1 tile, no vision, movement etc.

- add inventory system
	- entities can pick up and carry items
	- add carry capacity attribute to entities

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots
	> make a release

- sound & smell
	hearing & smelling

- dig/tunnel?

- Add additional movement methods (jump/fly)
- Stealth/Invisibility
- Teleportation
- Terrain affinity

- Weather / Temperature (Snow/Mud)

More static entities (see following for inspiration):
	> project zomboid streams
	> fallout tactics streams


CTF: Different humans and dogs
CTF: Neutral items that refresh stamina or give modifiers
CTF: Neutral items that can be picked up (requires inventory system)

CTF: Lobby: Back to Menu Button
	with proper server stop as host
	and server disconnect as client
	send message to others in lobby that player left

CTF: Pick up Flag (requires inventory system)
	> characters can now enter flag zone
	> characters in flag zone are "disabled" for the whole turn they were in
	> "disabled characters" cannot tag enemies
	> flag can be picked up when moving on that node for a cost
	> character can move with impairment with flag
	> flag zone moves with character holding flag
	> character holding flag can be tagged by enemy to win the game
	> flag can be dropped whenever by character for a cost

CTF Forest Generator:
	- elevated path towards building door (with stairs if necessary)
	- bridges when paths go over water


CTF: Neutral moving entities
 - Wolves
 - 1 sneaky wolf

CTF: more logic for dogs
  - dogs have a chance to not listen to commands and something else instead (random needs to be applied before sending to server so its synced)
  - can get distracted

CTF: Improve performance for far away pathfinding or disable, just find a solution for the lag spikes

CTF: Slopes use more action points
	> downwards * 1.25
	> upwards * 1.5

CTF: Upon end game show full visible map

CTF: more general modifier system
	> modifiers have a duration and effect, name, description, icon
	> move jail time to modifier
	> add ui for modifiers

CTF AI:
 - Attacker: new job: Flee if seeing opponent character that sees you too
 - New role: Flag cheater (go directly towards flag even if not visible)
 - Attacker roles can change when in own territory
 - Defender role can change during patrol

CTF: Rework hover pathfinding
	> Hover on unreachable node = no path preview
	> Hover on node with !canStandOn = red path preview
	> Hover on node within possible moves = green path preview
	> Hover on reachable node outside possible moves = yellow path preview
	> Cache paths (forever since they can never change atm)
	> Path preview max distance: If distance is bigger take node in that direction that is at max distance and show path to there
	> Clicking on yellow path moves as far as possible

CTF: Rework jail system
	> 1 Jail that is in neutral area
	> gives full vision for both players
	> Fully fenced off
	> Characters get teleported out of jail when jail time ends

-------- POSSIBLE PROJECT IDEAS WITH FRAMEWORK --------

- EcosystemSimulation3D
- Solo/Squad RPG (like CDDA)


-------- KNOWN ISSES --------

Camera MSAA Anti-Aliasing is causing black pixel artifacts on air node mesh seams that use the surface shader
	> so MSAA is turned off for now

Surface blending in SurfaceShader isn't perfect (but good enough so it's usually not noticable)

-------- RETIRED IDEAS ------------

- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1

Add a dissolve cutout feature to NodeMaterialShader that can dissolve an area around a specific screen space coordinate:
