--- World Generation Update

- Implement some line features for new map gen system
	> road
	> rail track
	> stroad
	> highway
	> creek
	> river

- Implement some parcels and content for them for new mapgen system
	> forest
	> park
	> neighbourhood
	> industry
	> mountain (cliff on 1 side)
	> swamp
	> pool

- CTF: Improve ctf map generator
	> New approach: Check XCOM and PZ map generation
	> Split map into parcels
	> Parcels have their own generation system on top of height map generation
	> Parcel generation depends on bordering parcels, roads, rivers, map edge
	> Parcels can be i.e. Forest, Suburb, Reservoir, Industrial area
	> Implement rules which parcels can be next to each other


	> 1. height map generation
	> 2. line features (river, road, railroad)
	> 3. parcel distribution
	> 4. parcel connection points (to line features and other parcels)
	> 5. parcel generation
	> 6. player base generation

--- Entity Update

- Allow static entities to be able to allow having moving entities on them
	> requires jumping update
	> add container

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor
	> same way as moving entities
	> IsPassable, BlocksVision, Dimensions, RequiresFlatTerrain

- Static entities with weird shapes
	> adjust collider generation accordingly
	> occupiednodes turns into footprint
	> shape is a dictionary<vector2int, list<bool>> whereas the key is the position in the footprint and the value list represents which nodes are blocked based on height
	> keep dimensions as a general entity attribute, add shape to static entity
	> Make editor script for static entity that allows defining shape and previewing box colliders

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

---


--- Update More Node Shapes

Allow 0022 for stairs
 - In node surface add rule that when 0022 shape draw a stair mesh instead of slope	

(> allow any height diffs on allowed shapes)
- Remove limit of max height diff within a node
	> slopes can also go up 2,3,etc.
	> keep shape requirements (max 2 different heights per node)
> implement climb/hillwalk system for slopes
	- have a slope value for each transition that is 0 for flat, +1 for going 1 tile up, -1 for going 1 down etc
		- for that have a getter for each node that gives back the height on the center of the node
		- also have a getter that gives back the height of each side8 of the node
		- then for the transition calculate the slope origin.center to origin.dir * 0.5 + target.oppositedir to target.center * 0.5
	- all entities have a max slope they can walk

- Expand entity shapes
	> Rework dimensions attribute of entities
	> Add new EntityShape class/struct
	> Each node within dimensions has a defined vision hitbox that can be [Full/None/Wall_N/E/S/W]
	> make it possible that entities can block a combination of full nodes, sides and corners
	> Impact vision
	> Impact navmesh

- Allow entites to have their own nodes

- Add UseTextures attribute to entity shader and support both modes on created models

---

- Editor: Decreasing tool size in ground sculpting doesn't remove overlay over previous chunks

- Editor: World Generation Tool: Expand by x chunks in direction

- Editor improvements:
	> wall height
	> air node drag
	> proc entity drag
	> tunnel (convert ground node with all walls, entites etc to air node and create new grass ground node 1 below)


Rework shader for entities
 - Allow switch between texture and color mode
 - Only use transparency shader on moving objects
 - Allow option to use uv space instead of world space
	> Apply this to doors

Make a list of material indexes colorable in editor
 - Save color in new attribute Color in entity and EntityData
 - all materials with an index present in the list will be given that color
 - Use for cars

 Water improvements
- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)
- Water flowing in one direction
- Waterfall
- water tool rework:
	> make max depth a const 3
	> make shoreheight based on mouse pointer y coordinate

Animation system for walking / climbing entities
	> silly with just hopping from one side to the other with slight rotation



- strength & destroy
	> movingentities get a new strength attribute
	> staticentities get a new durability attribute
	> walls get it too
	> entities can destroy for big stamina cost

- Minimap
	> shows tiles
	> shows current camera position
	> shows character positions
	> interactable to move camera

- Make flags carriable
	> make a framework for carryable entties/items
	> certain characters can carry it
	> impassable zones moves with carried flag
	> if character holding flag gets tagged = game over, no matter where
	> win game when flag is back home

- Dogs need a nearby master to work

- Jumping ability
	> to hop over fences
	> to hop over gaps
	> jumping ability 1 = hop over 1 tile gap, hop over 1 tile fence

- Horses
	- Rideable by humans
	
- Flying
	- Hawk
	- Can't tag or be tagged, fly at fixed height
	- Only give vision

- fix: water fill algorithm should stop after a while (like 1000 tiles?)

- In terrain blend transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- add new item framework
	- items behave like static entities on map, but way more limited
	- only one 1 tile, no vision, movement etc.

- add inventory system
	- entities can pick up and carry items
	- add carry capacity attribute to entities

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots
	> make a release

- sound & smell
	hearing & smelling

- tunnel?

- add some new static entities
	> for new static entity ideas watch project zomboid streams

improve vision system performance

- Add additional movement methods (jump/fly)
- Stealth/Invisibility
- Teleportation
- Terrain affinity

- Weather / Temperature (Snow/Mud)

- CTF: Improve performance for far away pathfinding or disable, just find a solution for the lag spikes
- CTF: Multiplayer

- CTF: Slopes use more action points
	> downwards * 1.25
	> upwards * 1.5

- CTF: Upon end game show full visible map

- CTF: Fix small bug that opponents sometimes stop moving right after starting moving when camera follows their movement, even though they stay visible

- CTF: more general modifier system
	> modifiers have a duration and effect, name, description, icon
	> move jail time to modifier
	> add ui for modifiers


- CTF: improve AI with job system
	> if we see enemy character in own zone => CHASE
	> if we see enemy flag => GO THERE
	> some "your turn" notification when turn starts

- CTF: Rework hover pathfinding
	> Hover on unreachable node = no path preview
	> Hover on node with !canStandOn = red path preview
	> Hover on node within possible moves = green path preview
	> Hover on reachable node outside possible moves = yellow path preview
	> Cache paths (forever since they can never change atm)
	> Path preview max distance: If distance is bigger take node in that direction that is at max distance and show path to there
	> Clicking on yellow path moves as far as possible

- CTF: Rework jail system
	> 1 Jail that is in neutral area
	> gives full vision for both players
	> Fully fenced off
	> Characters get teleported out of jail when jail time ends

- CTF: Make menu for creating game
	> Allow different map sizes
	> Miniscule: 7 chunks
	> Tiny: 9 chunks
	> Small: 11 chunks
	> Medium: 13 chunks
	> Big: 15 chunks
	> Huge: 17 chunks
	> Enormous: 20 chunks
	> Random


-------- POSSIBLE PROJECT IDEAS WITH FRAMEWORK --------

- EcosystemSimulation3D
- Solo/Squad RPG (like CDDA)


-------- KNOWN ISSES --------

Camera MSAA Anti-Aliasing is causing black pixel artifacts on air node mesh seams that use the surface shader
	> so MSAA is turned off for now

Surface blending in SurfaceShader isn't perfect (but good enough so it's usually not noticable)

-------- RETIRED IDEAS ------------

- Disallow 0101 and 1010 shapes
- Disallow 2110 and 0112 shapes

- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1

Add a dissovlce cutout feature to NodeMaterialShader that can dissolve an area around a specific screen space coordinate:
