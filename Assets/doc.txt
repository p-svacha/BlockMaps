------------------------- CTF v0.0.6 -------------------------
make path cost take slopes into consideration, down *1.2, up *1.5 per cell

New map(s): ideas listed below

desert map gen
	soft sand areas
	hard sand areas
	mostly flat
	dunes
	cactus +  shrub clusters
	shrubs
	palm clusters
	oasis (water with many trees around, some grass)
	single dead trees
	rocky mountains
	rocky mesas
	single small desert rocks


brutalist structure map

make valley map gen
	high sides with player spawns
	river in the middle
	some bridge crossings

farm map
	different crop fields with movement and vision modifiers
	one big farm building around neutral axis

inside dungeon like map

New map: MegaRandom
	just repeats random world modifiers



------------------------- END CTF v0.0.6 -------------------------

------------------------- CTF v0.0.7 -------------------------

Add Items to CTF:
	new Comp_CtfItem & CompProperties_CtfItem
	Active or Passive
	Characters can hold 1 item at a time
	Item is shown in CharacterInfo next to bars in a little square
	new action: use item
	new action: drop item
	new actions are added to special actions
	new actions can also be done by clicking on item in character info

Add "tag" system to map generator:
	Generators can apply tags (strings) to certain nodes
	Use these tags for spawning items
		Forest tags inside building nodes as spawnable for items
	CtfMapCreator will read these tags and have a chance to spawn an item on tagged nodes

Walking on an item adds it to the characters inventory if they don't hold another item yet

>>> List of items <<<
	jail-trap (2x2)
	catapult-trap (2x2)
	food that gives stamina
	tag-gun
	item that restores action points
	fernrohr that increases vision for one turn by a lot
	item that gives another character that disappears when tagged
		or small robot that will run out of battery

------------------------- END CTF v0.0.7 -------------------------

------------------------- CTF v0.0.8 -------------------------

try hosting a dedicated server that handles connections

if that works, create lobby browser

if that works, try hosting the game on a website

------------------------- END CTF v0.0.8 -------------------------


Framework Updates:

World.UpdateWorldSystems should enqueue changes so they don't get overwritten if the next World.UpdateWorldSystems is called while the previous is still running
	test by quickly changing surface of many nodes in editor

Walls that are not actually explored are visible when a wall on the same cell is explored
	> maybe one mesh per direction per height level?
	> maybe pass direction to shader?

Bug: redrawing entities resets their rotation because ResetWorldPositonAndRotation() is called in system update in reposition

Increase performance of detecting climb transitions on empty perlin map
maybe also other steps
Goal: 512 x 512 map (32 chunks) in 10 seconds preferred, 20 max. Now it takes like 50

fix arc for hop transitions - arc always has a height of 1 and going further down/up is just straight



--- Entity Nodes

make it possible to define invisible EntityNodes per entity
	> List<EntityNodeData>, where key is the local cell and value is the node altitudes
	> Can be defined up to 1 higher than entity height (like a crate has height 2, but a node could be defined at (0/2/0) with altitude (0,0,0,0) to make it walkable on top)
	> if it is forbid placing airnodes there
	> maybe an easy option to just add entity nodes everywhere at the top of the entity

EntityNodeData:
	Vector3Int pos, Dictionary<Direction, int> altitude, SurfaceDef surface

vision of entity node is based on entity
add HoveredEntityNode to world
	> make it possible to add fences/other entites on EntityNodes 

same with invisible EntityWalls for climbability
	> List<EntityWallData>
	> EntityWallData = Vector2Int + Direction + WallMaterialDef

---

give everyone names
turn counter and display

mapgen forest: don't replace concrete with dirt path
mapgen forest: wide road with cars
mapgen forest: river
mapgen forest: hedges should be straighter

--- Entity Update

- Allow static entities to be able to allow having moving entities on them
	> requires jumping update
	> add container

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor
	> same way as moving entities
	> IsPassable, BlocksVision, Dimensions, RequiresFlatTerrain

- Static entities with weird shapes
	> adjust collider generation accordingly
	> occupiednodes turns into footprint
	> shape is a dictionary<vector2int, list<bool>> whereas the key is the position in the footprint and the value list represents which nodes are blocked based on height
	> keep dimensions as a general entity attribute, add shape to static entity
	> Make editor script for static entity that allows defining shape and previewing box colliders

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

---

--- New cover layer for Nodes (for EcosystemSimulation)

New CoverLayerDef
nodes can have different layers stacked on top of each other
examples are AutumnLeaves, Snow, Moss

---


- Add MaxSteepness movement attribute and disallow walking on very steep nodes

- Expand entity shapes
	> Rework dimensions attribute of entities
	> Add new EntityShape class/struct
	> Each node within dimensions has a defined vision hitbox that can be [Full/None/Wall_N/E/S/W]
	> make it possible that entities can block a combination of full nodes, sides and corners
	> Impact vision
	> Impact navmesh

- Allow entites to have their own nodes
---

- Editor-Bug: Vision cutoff doesn't correctly reset when generating new map
- Editor-Bug: Decreasing tool size in ground sculpting doesn't remove overlay over previous chunks
- Editor-Feature: World Generation Tool: Expand by x chunks in direction

- Editor improvements:
	> pipette: press a button when hovering a wall/air node/fence etc. to instantly switch selection to that type
	> wall height
	> wall tool: click on existing wall to change shape/material (as long as side is valid for selected shape)
	> air node drag
	> proc entity drag
	> fence drag (same side along direction, i.e. if placed east you can drag along x axis and always place east)
	> tunnel (convert ground node with all walls, entites etc to air node and create new grass ground node 1 below)


Rework shader for entities
 - Allow option to use uv space instead of world space
	> Apply this to doors

Make a list of material indexes colorable in editor
 - Save color in new attribute Color in entity and EntityData
 - all materials with an index present in the list will be given that color
 - Use for cars

 Water improvements
- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)
- Water flowing in one direction
- Waterfall
- water tool rework:
	> make max depth a const 3
	> make shoreheight based on mouse pointer y coordinate

Animation system for walking / climbing entities
	> silly with just hopping from one side to the other with slight rotation

Sounds

Add "DrawSlopeAsStairs" to SurfaceDef.Renderproperties
	If true, all slopes (IsSlope = true) are drawn as stairs in DrawNodeSurface()

- strength & destroy
	> movingentities get a new strength attribute
	> staticentities get a new durability attribute
	> walls get it too
	> entities can destroy for big stamina cost

CTF: Minimap
	> shows tiles
	> shows current camera position
	> shows character positions
	> interactable to move camera

CTF: Make flags carriable
	> make a framework for carryable entties/items
	> certain characters can carry it
	> impassable zones moves with carried flag
	> if character holding flag gets tagged = game over, no matter where
	> win game when flag is back home

CTF: Dogs need a nearby master to work

CTF: Jumping ability
	> to hop over fences
	> to hop over gaps
	> jumping ability 1 = hop over 1 tile gap, hop over 1 tile fence

CTF: Horses
	- Rideable by humans
	
CTF: Flying
	- Hawk
	- Can't tag or be tagged, fly at fixed height
	- Only give vision

Framework: fix: water fill algorithm should stop after a while (like 1000 tiles?)

- add new item framework
	- items behave like static entities on map, but way more limited
	- only one 1 tile, no vision, movement etc.

- add inventory system
	- entities can pick up and carry items
	- add carry capacity attribute to entities

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots
	> make a release

- sound & smell
	hearing & smelling

- dig/tunnel?

- Add additional movement methods (jump/fly)
- Stealth/Invisibility
- Teleportation
- Terrain affinity

- Weather / Temperature (Snow/Mud)

More static entities (see following for inspiration):
	> project zomboid streams
	> fallout tactics streams


CTF: Add (last seen x turns ago) to entities not visible but explored
CTF: Rest ability (costs 10 AP, restores 10 stamina)

CTF: Neutral items that refresh stamina or give modifiers
CTF: Neutral items that can be picked up (requires inventory system)

CTF: Lobby: Back to Menu Button
	with proper server stop as host
	and server disconnect as client
	send message to others in lobby that player left



CTF: Pick up Flag (requires inventory system)
	> characters can now enter flag zone
	> characters in flag zone are "disabled" for the whole turn they were in
	> "disabled characters" cannot tag enemies
	> flag can be picked up when moving on that node for a cost
	> character can move with impairment with flag
	> flag zone moves with character holding flag
	> character holding flag can be tagged by enemy to win the game
	> flag can be dropped whenever by character for a cost

CTF Forest Generator:
	- elevated path towards building door (with stairs if necessary)
	- bridges when paths go over water


CTF: Neutral moving entities
 - Wolves
 - 1 sneaky wolf

CTF: more logic for dogs
  - dogs have a chance to not listen to commands and something else instead (random needs to be applied before sending to server so its synced)
  - can get distracted

CTF: Improve performance for far away pathfinding or disable, just find a solution for the lag spikes

CTF: Slopes use more action points
	> downwards * 1.25
	> upwards * 1.5

CTF: more general modifier system
	> modifiers have a duration and effect, name, description, icon
	> move jail time to modifier
	> add ui for modifiers

CTF: Rework hover pathfinding
	> Hover on unreachable node = no path preview
	> Hover on node with !canStandOn = red path preview
	> Hover on node within possible moves = green path preview
	> Hover on reachable node outside possible moves = yellow path preview
	> Cache paths (forever since they can never change atm)
	> Path preview max distance: If distance is bigger take node in that direction that is at max distance and show path to there
	> Clicking on yellow path moves as far as possible

-------- POSSIBLE PROJECT IDEAS WITH FRAMEWORK --------

- EcosystemSimulation3D
- Solo/Squad RPG (like CDDA)


-------- KNOWN ISSES --------

Camera MSAA Anti-Aliasing is causing black pixel artifacts on air node mesh seams that use the surface shader
	> so MSAA is turned off for now

Surface blending in SurfaceShader isn't perfect (but good enough so it's usually not noticable)

-------- RETIRED IDEAS ------------

- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1

Add a dissolve cutout feature to NodeMaterialShader that can dissolve an area around a specific screen space coordinate:
