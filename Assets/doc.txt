Big Features to Add:



-------- MOVEMENT UPDATE ------------

- DoubleClimbTransitions: Transitions where you climb up AND down to get to adjacent node
	- only for one-sided fences (!!!)
	- also for two-sided fences (even with different fence types, requires skill of toughest fence) (!!!)
	- also for cliff up fence down
	- also for fence up then cliff up then fence down
	- Implement animation system for climbing fences
- walls should generally block movement, but can be disabled with checkWalls = false (analog ladders)

- make moving entity presets and add them to selection
- these premade ones show their values in the input fields when selected and the input fields get disabled

- in nvamesh previews (both general and per entity):
	- also dont draw shadows
	- color based on transition type
	- size based on transition cost
- delay navmesh preview update 1 frame
- make climbtransition display nicer
- increase display performance
	- don't render whole map, but like 20 tiles around hovered tile or selected entity

- move "surface" attribute to surface node
	- remove water surface
	- remove isPaintable attribute from surface

- git page

- git release

- cache paths in one "MoveEntityTool" session

-------- BUILDING UPDATE ------------

- wall preview with height
- make height adjustable with (ctrl+scrollwheel)
- show wall type attributes in editor (climbability)

- make a ladderpreview
- make switchable to which higher node the ladder should go (with ctrl+scrollwheel)

- Add door WallType (Passable, but not seethrough)
- add window (impassable, see-through)

- Add some kind of roof system
	- maybe just allow changing height on normal air nodes (like on surface)
	- and then add a second air node type: roof

-------- WORLD GEN UPDATE ------------

- add generators
	=> flat empty grass
	=> current perlin with some trees and cliffs
	=> add dropdown for different generators

- check why it takes so long to generate big (16*32) worlds

- make a dropdown for load world
- make message "are you sure" when overwriting

- make detailed example map


-------- UNSORTED ------------

- Add additional movement methods (jump/fly)
- Add strength attribute with that you can destroy walls, entities
- Stealth/Invisibility
- Teleportation
- Terrain affinity

- Weather / Temperature (Snow/Mud)

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor

- bug: sometimes cliffs still get drawn when changin heights on big area

- interface IWorld for world with documentation
- also IEntity and IBlockmapNode

- Static entities with weird shapes
	=> adjust collider generation accordingly
	=> occupiednodes turns into footprint
	=> shape is a dictionary<vector2int, list<bool>> whereas the key is the position in the footprint and the value list represents which nodes are blocked based on height
	=> keep dimensions as a general entity attribute, add shape to static entity

- fix entity moving backwards when giving new GoTo command while moving already

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- improve water shader

- for new static entity ideas watch project zomboid streams

- dont allow suface nodes with walls in water
	- affect canplacewater
	- affect canbuildwall

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Make editor script for static entity that allows defining shape and previewing box colliders

- Add different air path types
	> each has their own mesh generator
	> each has their own attribute how many tiles they block above and below

- Add static entities that include navmesh nodes (like a container or bridge)

- Make profiler performance tests with high speed, high vision entities in editor

- Improve Camera:
	> Shift to increase speed
	> Faster zoom (alt to decrease zoom speed)
	> Fix zoom speed on low fps

- Fix rare bug of air node not being selected exactly on edge

- fix: water fill algorithm should stop after a while (like 1000 tiles?)

- In terrain blend transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots

- Procedural Static Entities

- Water shader (very small transparency, moving, foam when hitting terrain)

- decouple entity vision from node vision
	=> mainly so newly placed entities outside of a players vision are not automatically rendered

- add system to draw entities on last seen position from that players perspective

- add new item framework
	- items behave like static entities on map, but way more limited
	- only one 1 tile, no vision, movement etc.

- add inventory system
	- entities can pick up and carry items
	- add carry capacity attribute to entities

- START CTF



-------- RETIRED IDEAS ------------

- decouple entity visibility from node visiblity

- impelemnt SurfaceAirNodes:	
	> Rendered like surface nodes (1x1x1 in size)
	> BaseHeight = x and Height = {x+1,x+1,x+1,x+1}

- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1
