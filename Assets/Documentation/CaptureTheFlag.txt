========================= TODO's FOR v0.0.7 =========================

Alberto should be able to climb cliffs and more walls

"Scenting" Skill to detect things and flag outside of vision range:
	0 for humans, high for dogs
	Scented things get drawn as kind of a blob near the item (not revealing where and what EXACTLY it is)

Notifications:
	Rimworld like messages that appear for a player on certain triggers
	Messages can have related entities, that the camera jumps to when clicked on (cycles through them with each click)
	also shows arrows towards related entities when hovering over it
	Examples for notifications
		enemy gets visible
		character has been tagged (with reason)
		enemy stood on your trap
		you stood on enemy trap

========================= TODO's FOR v0.0.8 =========================

try hosting a dedicated server that handles connections

if that works, create lobby browser

if that works, try hosting the game on a website




========================= TODO's unsorted =========================


====== FROM PLAYTEST

dropping an item makes color weird on nodes you can go on

moving characters should have indicator on top rowd

enemies disappear for a second when moving through own character

items should have tooltip what they do

make flag pole be in center of tile

game crashes on winning

give preview of where climbing is possible without needing ability to move there right now

AI flees from ally towards its own territory, even though own character is closer to the center than it. It should go further into enemy territory

mark nodes in neutral territory with enemies on them not as passable/green


====== GENERAL IDEAS

CTF: "Scenting" Skill to detect things and flag outside of vision range:
	0 for humans, high for dogs
	Scented things get drawn as kind of a blob near the item (not revealing where and what EXACTLY it is)

	CTF: Minimap
	> shows tiles
	> shows current camera position
	> shows character positions
	> interactable to move camera

CTF: Make flags carriable
	> make a framework for carryable entties/items
	> certain characters can carry it
	> impassable zones moves with carried flag
	> if character holding flag gets tagged = game over, no matter where
	> win game when flag is back home

CTF: Dogs need a nearby master to work

CTF: Jumping ability
	> to hop over fences
	> to hop over gaps
	> jumping ability 1 = hop over 1 tile gap, hop over 1 tile fence

CTF: Horses
	- Rideable by humans
	
CTF: Flying
	- Hawk
	- Can't tag or be tagged, fly at fixed height
	- Only give vision

CTF: Add (last seen x turns ago) to entities not visible but explored
CTF: Rest ability (costs 10 AP, restores 10 stamina)

CTF: Neutral items that refresh stamina or give modifiers
CTF: Neutral items that can be picked up (requires inventory system)

CTF: Lobby: Back to Menu Button
	with proper server stop as host
	and server disconnect as client
	send message to others in lobby that player left



CTF: Pick up Flag (requires inventory system)
	> characters can now enter flag zone
	> characters in flag zone are "disabled" for the whole turn they were in
	> "disabled characters" cannot tag enemies
	> flag can be picked up when moving on that node for a cost
	> character can move with impairment with flag
	> flag zone moves with character holding flag
	> character holding flag can be tagged by enemy to win the game
	> flag can be dropped whenever by character for a cost

CTF Forest Generator:
	- elevated path towards building door (with stairs if necessary)
	- bridges when paths go over water


CTF: Neutral moving entities
 - Wolves
 - 1 sneaky wolf

CTF: more logic for dogs
  - dogs have a chance to not listen to commands and something else instead (random needs to be applied before sending to server so its synced)
  - can get distracted

CTF: Improve performance for far away pathfinding or disable, just find a solution for the lag spikes

CTF: more general modifier system
	> modifiers have a duration and effect, name, description, icon
	> move jail time to modifier
	> add ui for modifiers

CTF: Rework hover pathfinding
	> Hover on unreachable node = no path preview
	> Hover on node with !canStandOn = red path preview
	> Hover on node within possible moves = green path preview
	> Hover on reachable node outside possible moves = yellow path preview
	> Cache paths (forever since they can never change atm)
	> Path preview max distance: If distance is bigger take node in that direction that is at max distance and show path to there
	> Clicking on yellow path moves as far as possible

CTF Map Ideas:
		
	- Caste ruins:
		- inspired by ruine farnsburg
		- Mix of inside and outside areas

	- Brutalist structure:
		- non-realistic concrete structures
		- hard edges
		- stairs
		- many layers
		- inspired by old video games

	- Valley:
		- High elevation on both sides where players start
		- River in the low valley in the middle neutral area
		- Some bridge crossings over the river
		- Some cliffs in the elevation

	- Farm:
		- Many crop fields with paths and/or tree lines between them
		- Crops that can be moved through but reduce vision (i.e. corn)
		- Big farm building somewhere in neutral area

	- Dungeon:
		- inspired by fallout tactics, binding of isaac
		- just random rooms stitched together

	- MegaRandom:
		- just repeats different world modifiers from other generators
		- some restrctions (i.e. in first step just terrain modifiers, then entity modifiers, then buildings, etc.)
