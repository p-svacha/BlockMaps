General next planned to-do's.

- Create 8x8 chunk maps with that new generator
- If performance of generation is slow, check ways to fix that
- Add character with vision range of 64 (!) to that map
- In that testing setup (with fixed seen even maybe), improve performance of vision calculation (/c/68de9312-cce4-8327-9fea-5d8acf7220b8)
- Start with turn-based-tactics prototype
