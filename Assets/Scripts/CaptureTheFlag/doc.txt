Big Features to Add:

- Add editor tool to spawn test characters with editable movement and vision

- Improve vision algorithm:
	> Variant 1: Fixed rules based on vision range + height. Static entities block vision based on hitbox
	> Variant 2: Line of sight based on shooting rays to all nodes within vision range. if ray hits node or entity on node it is visible.

- Static Entities 
	> affect vision range (fully block or reduce)
	> affect movement (fully block or reduce)

- Procedural Static Entities

- Water (or general liquid system) with unique properties
	> placed in world by filling in hole: can only be 1 tile deep
	> make own shader

- Fences between tiles

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Different type of air nodes: path & terrain

- Add fences to air paths if no connection in that direction

- Improve Camera:
	> Shift to increase speed
	> Faster zoom (alt to decrease zoom speed)

- Fix rare bug of air node not being selected exactly on edge

- In terrain transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- Save/Load Worlds in editor

- Drag hold to paint surfaces in editor

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots
