Big Features to Add:


make editor entity 2 tall

make placing an entity update the vision of all entities that see it

improve pathfinding for moving entites that are tall
	> Make pathfinding take an entity as an input and modify canTransition

- correctly implement !blocksvision of entities

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Shoot multiple rays at a node to check vision (if performance allows)
	> also at entities on node

- Make editor moving entities selectable and manually movable, also auto-move

- Show entity stats in static entity tool in editor

- Get rid of World.TILE_SIZE

- Water (or general liquid system) with unique properties
	> placed in world by filling in hole: can only be 1 tile deep
	> make own shader

- Move helper functions in Pathfinder to World

- Make Selection UI thing for editor a general UI prefab

- Fences/Walls between tiles

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1x1

- impelemnt SurfaceAirNodes:	
	> Rendered like surface nodes (1x1x1 in size)
	> BaseHeight = x and Height = {x+1,x+1,x+1,x+1}

- Add fences to air paths if no connection in that direction

- Improve Camera:
	> Shift to increase speed
	> Faster zoom (alt to decrease zoom speed)

- Fix rare bug of air node not being selected exactly on edge

- In terrain transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- Save/Load Worlds in editor

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots

- Add selection over multiple tiles (2x2, 3x3 etc.)
	> Add feature to height change, surface change and air path

- Fix bug with cliff mesh generation when adjacent slopes overlap (test in high altitude)

- Procedural Static Entities
