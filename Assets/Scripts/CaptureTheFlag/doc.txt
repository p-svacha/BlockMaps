Big Features to Add:

- Make static entities affect vision

- Improve vision algorithm:
	> Variant 1: Fixed rules based on vision range + height. Static entities block vision based on hitbox
	> Variant 2: Line of sight based on shooting rays to all nodes within vision range. if ray hits node or entity on node it is visible.

- Make vision radius of entities based on their dimensions

- Water (or general liquid system) with unique properties
	> placed in world by filling in hole: can only be 1 tile deep
	> make own shader

- Move helper functions in Pathfinder to World

- Make Selection UI thing for editor a general UI prefab

- Fences/Walls between tiles

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Allow movingentities bigger than 1x1x1

- impelemnt SurfaceAirNodes:	
	> Rendered like surface nodes (1x1x1 in size)
	> BaseHeight = x and Height = {x+1,x+1,x+1,x+1}

- Add fences to air paths if no connection in that direction

- Improve Camera:
	> Shift to increase speed
	> Faster zoom (alt to decrease zoom speed)

- Fix rare bug of air node not being selected exactly on edge

- In terrain transitions, only do corner transitions when the corner transition exists
	> else pass -1 in the blend array and ignore in shader code
	> also add (global perlin) noise to blending texture

- Save/Load Worlds in editor

- Improve GitHub page with desc and screenshots

- Add selection over multiple tiles (2x2, 3x3 etc.)
	> Add feature to height change, surface change and air path

- Fix bug with cliff mesh generation when adjacent slopes overlap (test in high altitude)

- Procedural Static Entities
