Big Features to Add:

- Fix bug that moving entities flicker through air paths on slope edges.

- Expand shader to allow surface textures
	> add transitions

- Fix bug that hovering an airnode only works in 2 directions

- Showing / Hiding / Tinting individual tiles

- Vision / Line of Sight
	> Variant 1: Fixed rules based on vision range + height. Static entities block vision based on hitbox
	> Variant 2: Line of sight based on shooting rays to all nodes within vision range. if ray hits node or entity on node it is visible.

- Static Entities 
	> affect vision range (fully block or reduce)
	> affect movement (fully block or reduce)

- Procedural Static Entities

- Water (or general liquid system) with unique properties
	> placed in world by filling in hole: can only be 1 tile deep
	> make own shader

- Fences between tiles

- Static entities types: Like high grass, maize, foliage, debris, puddle
	> multiple static entities per node: one per type

- Different type of air nodes: path & terrain

- Add fences to air paths if no connection in that direction
